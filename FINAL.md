For our final the story line follows the unfortunate crash landing of a cruise boat on an island. The main character is trying to find their way off the island and trying to survive the curve balls that the island presents them. The character has two options, try to signal for help or to build shelter. There is three ways to survive. One being the character being rescued by a helicopter, the other being a tribe on the island taking in the character and they live out the rest of their days on the island. The last one would be if you choose to not go on the cruise at all, thus saving your life!

The [screenshot](https://github.com/pitt-cdm/twine--shore-leave/blob/master/stylesheet.PNG) we changed the background to be a light blue to reflect the color of the water surrounding the island. There is a possibility that the character dies in the process of survival, so choose wisely!

With the one workshop day, we were able to split up the work that we wanted to get done. We made basically the entire story. We added photos and connected all the cards we also began to add some sound. to get the sound to play while the photos also appear Currently, our Twine game meets all the criteria. We acheieved many aspirational goals including adding photos, sound and css and we hope to have created a game that will leave people wondering: can I survive?
