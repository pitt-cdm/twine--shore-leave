<!-- What's the basic pitch for the Twine narrative? Where do you start? Who do you play as? What's the genre? -->
The basic pitch is a survival game. The starting scene is that a family's boat crashes onto an island in the middle of the ocean, and you have a choice to play as the mother, the father, the son, or the daughter. Each of the four characters has a different narrative and many of the individual storylines converge.  


<!-- What overall mode of collaboration are you planning to use: divide the work by project sections? by media types and expertise? by compromise and consensus all the way through?-->
